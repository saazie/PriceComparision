    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>PriceCompare</strong>. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our website.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Non-personal information:</strong> Browser type, device type, pages visited, referral source, and anonymous analytics data to help improve the site.</li>
      <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> We use cookies and similar technologies to provide basic functionality and to analyze site usage. You can control cookies through your browser settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deliver and improve the website experience;</li>
      <li>Analyze site usage and trends;</li>
      <li>Display product listings and comparison results;</li>
      <li>Support and respond to user inquiries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Affiliate Links & Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>PriceCompare participates in affiliate programs including Amazon, eBay, AliExpress, and Etsy. We may earn a commission when you click affiliate links and make qualifying purchases — this does not increase your purchase price.</p>
    <p>We may also use third-party services (for analytics, hosting, etc.). Those services have their own privacy policies; we recommend reviewing them directly.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing & Security</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or rent personal information to third parties. We may share non-personal aggregated data with partners. We implement reasonable security measures to protect information, but no internet transmission is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You may disable cookies in your browser at any time. Disabling cookies may affect some site functions. For privacy questions or to request data removal, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@pricecompare.com">support@pricecompare.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>Our site is intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy occasionally. The “Last updated” date will reflect the change. Continued use of the site after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>
